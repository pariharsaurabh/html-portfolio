    <p>I've been playing guitar for 13 years now. I started this as my hobby and currently pursuing my career as a full time musician. I am not genre biased. I love mostly all kind of music I am exposed to. I love the fact that how manipulating sound and silences we have created such a beautiful thing as music.  </p>
